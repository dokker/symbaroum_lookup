The tracking is impeccable until the blighted one crosses water – if it does, the ritual must be performed again on the far side of the stream. Should the test fail, the mystic cannot try again until the next day. Also, it is harder to track blight-stricken creatures within larger settlements and in Davokar, giving the mystic a second chance of failing the test; the player must roll twice and if one of those fails, so does the ritual."

In the case of a failure the mystic can still try to force an answer from the dead, but at the risk of becoming possessed by the spirit; roll [Resolute←Resolute].

The ritual requires a link to the victim for the mystic to even be able to attempt the possession: a lock of hair, a splash of blood or an item that is important to the intended victim. The victim recalls everything that happens during the possession, but sees these events more as a surreal dream than an actual memory. The victim cannot be made to commit suicide while possessed, but can otherwise be made to go against all its principles. The possession can be observed as a change in the Shadow, as the victim gains the Shadow of the mystic. The possession can be broken by either Exorcism or Break Link. If done by using Exorcism, the mystic cannot possess the same creature ever again. The mystic's own body remains in a trance during the possession. If the borrowed body is killed during the possession then the mystic's mind and spirit are thrown back into its own body. The same happens if the mystic's body is harmed or exposed to some kind of powerful interference (like being shoved, drenched in water or affected by heat and smoke, etc.)."

For each turn the theurg stands in the fire, it suffers 1D6 damage, and if a [Resolute –Damage] test is passed, one (1) point of permanent Corruption is removed. If the test fails, the mystic throws itself from the pyre and the ritual is interrupted. Performing the ritual costs one (1) point of Experience, whether it is successful or not.

The form of the plant is partially under the control of the mystic, and a tree can become a bridge or smash a gate to splinters. However, the mystic has no control over the seasons; the plant takes the form that it naturally has during the current season. The location where this seed is planted must meet the conditions required for the plant to grow to full size under natural circumstances. In other words, an oak cannot be planted in a dark cave without light and soil, but maybe vines can take root there and grow into lianas for people to climb. In a Witch Circle created by the same mystic, the ritual Quick Growth can be performed regardless of the season."

Abominations (creatures that are members of the Abomination monster category) feel sick when getting close to an area that has been sanctified, and suffer 1D4 damage that ignores Armor each turn they remain on holy ground. Creatures that are tainted but have not yet turned into a true abomination experience a strong discomfort when around sacred locations and objects.

During desperate moments of the war, the battle mages of Ordo Magica took increasingly greater risks in the name of necessity and thereby brought Corruption upon themselves. To counteract this evil they dusted off an ancient and shunned ritual, by which one can capture the soul of a dying creature in a crystal prepared for the purpose. That same ritual proved to work well in order to drain Corruption from a wizard and transfer it to the soul in the stone. The ritual binds the mystic to the crystal, which then works as an extension of the wizard's soul. The ritual allows the mystic to move 1D4 points of permanent Corruption to the soul stone with a successful Resolute test. The stone can hold up to half of the mystic's Resolute in Corruption; it darkens as it fills up and detonates if said limit is surpassed. The collected Corruption then rushes back to the mystic, often with a rather nasty result. In the unlikely case that he or she survives that wave of Corruption, it is possible for the mystic to bind itself to a new soul stone and start over. The ritual costs one (1) point of Experience to perform, whether it is successful or not. A wizard that manages to learn the ritual receives a soul stone from its order chapter; other mystics must pay their own way. To buy a soul stone costs 100 thaler."

The summoned creature will try to reach the location to the best of its abilities but does not necessarily know why it wants to go there, other than following an irresistible calling. The only way to protect a creature that has been summoned is to trick and lure it to step inside a mystically shielded area (the Sanctifying Rite, Witch Circle or Sanctum rituals) or use the Break Link ritual."

The mystic must touch its victim, and the victim can notice the mind-reading if the mystic fails a [Discreet←Vigilant] test.

The mystic decides how things grow and which season it is within, and can with the Quick Growth ritual create an environment to mirror its heart's delight. It is hard to find a Witch Circle, even if you know where to look for it. It requires a [Vigilant←Discreet] test to even see the circle if encountered in the wilderness. Creatures that do not see the circle will simply walk around it, without knowing they have taken a short detour. A mystic with both the Witch Circle ritual and the Alchemy ability can make an extra attempt at Alchemy tests when using the ability inside its circle. A mystic with Quick Growth, Witch Circle and Alchemy can make two extra attempts when using Alchemy. A mystic who performs Borrow Beast and lets its body rest inside a Witch Circle has no limitation as to how long it can maintain the trance, since its body gets all the nutrition it needs from the ground inside the circle."

The person can read the signs of the wild, knows what places to avoid, and is used to finding food, water, and shelter in hostile environments. While moving through ruins or wilderness, the person can pass a Vigilant test to gather 1d6 rations of food and water per day, or 1d10 rations if that is the person's sole focus (no movement). Bushcraft can be acquired multiple times, in which case it can be used in increasingly hostile environments. For example, level I corresponds to places such as Bright Davokar and the outskirts of the mountains; level II to Wild Davokar and the deep mountain valleys; level III to Dark Davokar and the Underworld (the Game Master decides).

		"description":"Symbolism was developed in the east, beyond the Ravens, in what the symbolists call “The first city of humans” – a place of myth, lost somewhere in the vast deserts of the eastern wastes. Nowadays, the symbolists gather in Vajvod, in eastern Davokar, even though some of them travel far and wide in their search for knowledge of runes, signs and symbols. The basic assumption of the symbolists states that the world consists of signs and symbols, and that it therefore may be affected and influenced by altering signs and symbols which represent its diverse features. The powers of Symbolism are created by drawing or writing. More fanciful procedures are also possible, like embroidery, etchings or weaves. Procedures aside, the power of the symbol is released by the symbolist's command, and the symbol vaporizes when its power has been unleashed. Creating a symbol gives no corruption but when it is activated the one who uses it suffers one (1) point of temporary corruption.",
		"novice":"<span class='text-success'>Novice</span>. Special. The character has begun to grasp the power of runes. The signs must be physically represented – carved, painted, etched, tattooed – which takes time; for a novice, it takes one hour to create a power symbol. However, it only takes a combat action to activate a symbol, which is done by uttering an activation phrase. Note that the symbolist has to see or be in direct contact (melee range) with the symbol in order to activate it. The symbolist can only have one symbol per mystical power prepared in this way. When a symbol has been used it must be recharged, which takes as much time as it does to create the symbol from scratch.",
		"adepte":"<span class='text-info'>Adept</span> Special. With a combat action, the symbolist can quickly paint a symbol in a book or draw it in the mud or dust of the ground. These temporary symbols transcend the limitation stating that the symbolist may only have one symbol per power prepared. To the adept, activating symbols – no matter if they are prepared in a more permanent fashion (see novice) or are of a temporary nature – is a free action where he or she only has to utter a single word. However, only one symbol may be activated per turn. In addition, the adept symbolist can choose to activate symbols using a physical trigger instead of a word. The trigger is decided by the mystic when the symbol is created, and can for instance be that a living creature enters a room, that someone steps on the symbol or that a weapon is drawn within melee range. The symbolist may or may not exclude him- or herself from this equation, but the allies of the symbolist cannot be excluded: if they act in accordance with the trigger, the symbol is activated. The adept can erase one of his or her own symbols with a simple gesture (free action), but this requires actually touching the symbol.",
		"maitre":"<span class='text-danger'>Master</span> Active. As a combat action, the symbolist can draw flaming power runes in the air and activate them as part of the same action. Hence, the symbols work just like the powers of other traditions, aside from the mystic only suffering one point in temporary corruption per activation. These momentary symbols transcend the limitation stating that the symbolist may only have one symbol per power prepared."

The Quake can be aimed at a physical structure and then crush doors, windows and bridges; the mystic can strike the targeted structure with the staff, or throw the staff using the power Staff Projectile. No matter if the Quake is directed into the ground or towards an object, the mage suffers 1d6 temporary corruption upon activation Into the ground: The mage strikes the ground and sets off shock waves that topple all creatures nearby with a passed [Resolute←Quick] test – one roll per creature, ally or enemy. The mystic and adjacent allies are excluded from the effect, just like any enemies within melee range. Those who fall suffer 1d4 damage, ignoring armor. Towards an object: The Quake is powerful enough to crush bridges, walls and doors. The damage dealt is rolled as a usual hit with the staff, but the quality Razing is added thanks to the ritual; the staff damages structures as if it is a battering ram. See the rule Damage on Buildings, page 106, for more information. Doors turn to splinters while floors and bridges crumble to dust. If the mystic crushes a floor, he or she remains standing on the edge of the rupture, but before him or her a hole big enough to require two movement actions to get around opens up. Naturally, if it instead is a bridge that is crushed, anyone wanting to pass must climb or swim to the other side."

If the test is successful, the creature must obey the mystic as if bound by a slave rune, and can only be freed by the death of its master. The creature keeps all stats and abilities it had in life and is also gifted with the monstrous trait Undead at level I. It does not age but will not go on forever, since its body is in a constant state of slow decomposition. The creature must make a test against Strong each year – if the test fails the creature's value in Strong is reduced by one point.

Demonologists know how to summon daemons to the world of the living, and can force them into service. These daemons come in three different forms and the summoning of each requires the use of a separate ritual, but since the procedures share many characteristics they are described together. Irrespective of the type of daemon to be summoned, the procedure is the same: the creature must appear within a symbol prepared on the ground, and wise demonologists make sure to learn, and use, the ritual Magic Circle in order to protect themselves if something goes wrong during the summoning. Summoning a daemon requires no test to be rolled once the special symbol has been created; however, in order to subdue the daemon and make it obey the demonologist, a test against [Resolute←Resolute] must be passed. A blood sacrifice in the form of a living Cultural Being gives the mystic a second chance to pass the test, and if the victim has no permanent corruption the mystic also gains a +1 bonus on the test. If the test is successful, the daemon does the mystic a service; if the test fails, the daemon is free to do whatever it wishes until the same time next day. The creature cannot stay longer than that unless it is bound to the service of the demonologist. Whether or not the daemon is bound to the mystic, it can never enter magic circles, witch circles or a site protected by Sanctum. The demonologist may only bind one daemon at a time; if more are summoned, the one already bound is freed and will remain in the world for twenty-four hours before returning to its place of origin. However, if the mystic knows more than one of the summoning rituals, he or she can have one daemon of each type in service. The three rituals let the mystic summon a specific type of daemon – either a Vindictive, a Knowledgeable or a Guardian daemon. The ritual costs one point in Experience to perform, whether the test to control the daemon is a success or a failure.<br/><i>Daemons description : See Advanced Player Guide pages 94-95.</i>"

Melee Range Radius: 1–2 meters, meaning one creature and all others in its direct vicinity – those who are in melee combat with the target or who could be without having to spend a movement action. Short Radius: 10 meters, meaning all who are within a movement action from the targeted spot on the ground. Cone: Anyone present in front of the weapon is at risk of being hit when the weapon is fired. If movement by scale is used on a grid, the cone is as wide as the distance from the weapon.

The counterpart may be a non-player character important to the game or the character of another player; talk to your gaming friends and decide what is best.

The drug (wine, dream snuff, daft root or similar) costs one shilling per dose. An alchemist can create the drug for himself or a friend for half that price. Withdrawal symptoms give a –1 modification to all tests and grow worse day-by-day, up to –5. Each day without the drug, the character must also pass a [Resolute –the abstinence modification] test.

Concealing the traits requires the character to pass a [Discreet←Vigilant] test. If the test is failed, the character will have a second chance at failing all Persuasive tests concerning pleas for help or protection. However, the bestial exterior grants a second chance to pass all Persuasive tests meant to threaten or intimidate.

	"Code of Honor":{
		"type":"fardeau",
		"livre":"gdj",
		"novice":"The character has adopted a very strict code of honor, applicable in all situations but especially burdensome in combat.

Should the dark secret become publicly known, the character gets one of the burdens Pariah or Wanted instead, depending on the secret. Once per adventure there is a risk for exposure; the character must roll a Discreet test during each adventure, a test with a second chance to succeed. If failed, someone discovers a clue which can lead to the truth. Maybe some kind of physical evidence surfaces (a letter, for instance)? Is it a witness claiming to have seen something or is the character talking in his sleep? Whether the suspicious person is a non-player character or a character, the one with the dark secret must lay their curiosity to rest or suffer the consequences.

If the first success test of the day is a success, it is a good day and everything seems to be alright; if the first test of the day is a failure, it is a bad day – the gout sets in, all joints are aching or the character is out of breath even when seated. Whatever the cause, the character has –1 on all tests for the day."

	"Epileptic":{
		"type":"fardeau",
		"livre":"gdj",
		"novice":"The character is afflicted by a sensitive mind, meaning that he or she can be exposed to violent cramps throughout the body when excited or stressed. If rolling a 20 on a success test the cramping starts and the character is down and out for 1d6 turns. Afterward, he or she is exhausted and suffers –1 on all success tests until the end of the scene."

This means that as soon as the player opens his or her mouth and says that the character does something, it does – and the player cannot have second thoughts. The only way to restrain the character is to sacrifice an Experience point or accept one (1) permanent corruption."

The protégé can be a beloved child, an elderly but respected mentor, a soulmate or just an annoying relative whose welfare is connected to a future inheritance for the character. Either way, this person is played by the Game Master and tends to get into trouble. The protégé has no stats besides those associated with weak resistance, and gains no Experience from adventuring – he or she is as much a burden over time, as at the start. If the protégé dies or goes missing, the character is afflicted by other problems; sorrow and remorse, mirrored in a suitable burden. If the character protected the person from love, burdens like Addiction or Nightmares can be appropriate. And if the protection was related to personal gains, maybe Wanted or Arch Enemy is better – the relatives of the protégé do not easily forget the characters betrayal."

		"description":"Ritualist is an Incremental Ability. You cannot buy the Ritualist ability directly with Experience. Instead, you advance the level of your Ritualist ability by learning new rituals. Learning any ritual costs 10 XP and takes 1D4 weeks of study. Unless the ritual is of the mystic's tradition, the character suffers 1 point of Permanent Corruption when they learn the ritual and 1D4 Temporary Corruption every time they perform it. If the ritual is of the mystic's tradition, they take no Permanent Corruption from learning it and only 1 Temporary Corruption from performing it.",

The character can immediately recognize the signs, components, and effects of the rituals they have learned, and may roll Cunning to identify the signs and effects of any ritual from a tradition the mystic has studied (if the character knows one ritual from Wizardry, one ritual from Witchcraft, and one ritual from Sorcery, they can attempt to identify rituals from any of those traditions).",

The character can immediately recognize the signs, components, and effects of the rituals they know, and may roll Cunning to identify any ritual from any tradition. The ritualist may also spend an hour at any ritual site and roll Resolute to gain an innate understanding of the effects of the ritual. For example, the master ritualist could read the remains of a Summoning ritual to learn the identity of the creature that was summoned, or attune himself to a magic circle to learn the details of the last time someone used Seven League Stride to travel from or to that circle."
